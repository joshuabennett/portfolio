## Description

Portfolio website to showcase my aesthetic and my projects. I'm looking for Web Development opportunities so contact me if you're hiring!

## Technologies

Built with Vue.

## Learning Lessons

Overall this project wasn't too difficult as I tried to keep it minimal as that is my aesthetic. The most challenging part was definitely the Animations. There's alot of different animations and each presented their own problems. I still don't have the expansion of the Projects how I want it to be, since Vue doesn't load it's state smoothly with my animations.
